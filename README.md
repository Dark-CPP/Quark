# Quark
C++ Library to help create a programming language with ease

## How This Works

It parses the string/file in 3 steps:

<li>Parses a string into a token array</li>
<li>Parses the token array into a node tree by applying a set of user defined rules</li>
<li>Goes thorough the node tree and executes a set of functions to use the node tree</li>

## Example
